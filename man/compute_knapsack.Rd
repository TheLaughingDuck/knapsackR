\title{The \code{brute_force_knapsack} function}
\source{
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knapsack_problem}{The wikipedia article on the Knapsack problem}
}
\usage{
compute_knapsack(i, x, W)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A dataframe containing the objects that can go in the knapsack.
It has two variables \code{v} indicating the value of the object, and \code{w} indicating the weight of the object.}

\item{W}{A numeric indicating the size of the knapsack. In other words: the maximum weight that the knapsack can support.}
}
\value{
A list of $value: the maximum knapsack value (numeric), and $elements: The rows in \code{x} that achieve this value, in the form of a vector.
}
\description{
This function solves the knapsack problem through the brute force method: It calculates the combined value for each possible combination of objects and returns the best combination that still respects the maximum weight requirement.
